# Sal-Portfolio
Made a portfolio for Sal.

## Description

- Made a portfolio for Sal so he can send it to potential employers when he starts applying for jobs. I wrote the code from scratch creating both the Html and Css files. I also included a reset file in this project. I made sure the page is responsive on many different types viewport sizes.
